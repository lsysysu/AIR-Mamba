# AIR-Mamba
AIR-Mamba is a lightweight SSM-based architecture with â€‹real-time domain adaptation capability, specifically designed for cross-environment robustness in IR-UWB radar-based UAV recognition. This repository serves as the official implementation of the paper "Domain-Adaptive UAV Recognition Using IR-UWB Radar and a Lightweight Mamba-Based Network". Code will be released upon publication.
