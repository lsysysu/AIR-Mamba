# Dataset Information

This project uses a proprietary IR-UWB radar dataset collected for UAV classification under varying domain conditions.

## Data Description

- **Radar Type:** IR-UWB (Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband)
- **Signal Format:** Raw ADC echo data (256Ã—256 images per sample)
- **Collection Environments:**
  - Anechoic chamber (clean)
  - Urban
  - Suburban
  - Marine

- **Number of Classes:** 6 UAV categories

## Access Policy

Due to ongoing publication and data protection concerns, the full dataset is not publicly available at this stage.

We plan to release a cleaned and anonymized version of this dataset after the acceptance of our paper:

> **Li, Shengyuan**, Dong, Xinyue, Fan, Yiheng, Zhu, Xiangwei, and Yuan, Xuelin.  
> "Domain-Adaptive UAV Recognition Using IR-UWB Radar and a Lightweight Mamba-Based Network."  
> *IEEE Sensors Journal*, under review, 2024.
